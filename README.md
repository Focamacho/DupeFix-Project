DupeFix Project is a mod made for Minecraft 1.12.2 that fixes dupes in other mods.

The reason this mod exists is to fix as many dupes as possible so that modpacks and servers can take advantage of several mods without having to ban items from them.

Most mods here are either no longer updated, or no longer receive updates for Minecraft 1.12.2.Â So to keep them usable on modpacks and servers, this mod was created.
